# Hidden Line Server

The sole reason for this app to exist is to provide user with ability to protect its own privacy and to provide a way for others to stay away from eyes of global industry and any unwished watchers.

Please keep in mind that privacy is not the same as ilegal activity. Keep yourself withing borders of legal system and protect your privacy altogether- that is the basic idea.

This app is built under openjdk 11 and is intended to run on the tomcat server. Main purpose is to serve as the server for the upcoming android app and to work on the tor network. You can use it on some public network using ssl certificates for security purposes, if you prefere, but my android app will not support that. On the other hand you can just open yout tor browser and use it like any other chat server.

What about logs and recording user behaviour. There are none. This app keeps no logs, and saves no data outside of ram. All of data used for operation of this server like user names and passwords are stored in ram and, as you probably gessed, whey you turn your server off, all of data is lost... that is the point... even if you wish, there will be no recording of your communication.

### How it works?

1.Administator is going to log in server with credentials ('admin', 'password')
2.Change of admin user name and password is mandatory and please do so on the next page
3.Log back in with your new credentials and add user names and passwords for every user that is going to use your server
4.Log out
5.Log back in as user and start play around

### How to compile?

1.Import entire project into eclipse
2.Build project

Thank you and stay safe.
